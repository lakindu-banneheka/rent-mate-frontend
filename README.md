when doing this i added navigation and sub navigation names and links are given by a external variables so it is a dynamic component based on the user role it deside what side bar data to show

i also added them in several components so it can be easy to read and update if needed

Then the Footer of the page 

I also make it more readable by making components and passed data so the data can be passed easily
